#Horiseon Marketing Agency - Code Refactor

##Description

Horiseon Marketing Agency is a company that assists clients with their websites to improve their search engine optimization, increase leads and visits, and market their site to the appropriate viewers. The purpose of this project was to repair Horiseon's current codebase so that it met accessibility standards as well as optimize their own website for search engines. 

The code given, although fully functioning, was not considered semantic - i.e. the code was too cluttered, inefficient and lacking appropriate detail.
By refactoring the code, the website will experience improved search engine optimization without altering any of the styling.

###Tasks Completed
- An appropriate title was given
- HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements
- CSS classes were consolidated to minimise the amount of code
- CSS classes and elements were organised to coincide with the order of code in the HTML file
- Alt tags were added to all images
- Explanatory comments were added to the HTML code
- Explanatory comments were added to the CSS code.
